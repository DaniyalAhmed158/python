# Variables
# Varriables are like empty containers which can contain any type of data
# a=10
# print (a)
# b=20
# print (b)
#Data types that can be stored in varriables and can be used for programs
# Strings(A,1,/,@) Straings are presented as same as they have been written in program
# Booleans(Decision making) (True or False)
# Integers, float(Decimal values), Complex numbers
# None (This is a data type that is used to give a decision to do nothing after this condition)

# Strings
print ("String: This whole sentence is a string along with the spaces in between the words")
print ("If I have to write this in 2 lines \nHow would I do that ?")
# \n is a break statement that breakes the sentence in 2 line
# or put the remaining part of the statement on second line

# # Booleans
# a = 10
# print (a)
# b = a == 15
# print (b)
# b =a == 10
# print(b)
